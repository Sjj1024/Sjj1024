    - title: Loves Freedom
      details: Whether it's physical freedom or freedom of the soul, I haven't achieved it yet. My body is sold to the company, and my soul is still wandering
      icon: 🎨
    - title: Values Health
      details: Health is fundamental. Without it, everything is just empty talk. The moment you step into a hospital, your body and your wallet are no longer yours.
      icon: 🌈
    - title: Enjoys Life
      details: Enjoy every moment of the present—the comfort of sunlight on your skin, the breeze brushing your face, green trees swaying beside you, and those beautiful people.
      icon: 🌍
    - title: Open Source Enthusiast
      details: GitHub is my favorite. I don’t know when it started—maybe the day I downloaded the GitHub app. Now I check it daily for interesting stuff.

    - title: Fruit King
      details: Fruits are the most delicious things in the world. When I was a child, our yard had peach, apricot, and plum trees. We used to sleep under them on summer nights.

    - title: Loves Adventure
      details: I love exploring interesting things—fantasizing about driving an off-road vehicle in the wilderness, riding a mountain bike across wild lands. Hahahahahahahahaha!

    - title: Writes Articles
      details: I like to write about problems I encounter at work. I started on CSDN, but as CSDN became overly commercial, I began syncing articles to Juejin and other platforms.

    - title: Takes Photos
      details: I started with a Canon M50, played with it for two years, then sold it. Last year, I got a Canon M10 again. I enjoy shooting beautiful landscapes and beautiful people.

    - title: Makes Videos
      details: After PakePlus went viral, I realized many people don't like reading tutorials, so I started making videos. To my surprise, many people watched them.
